# Reversi Game

This is a text-based reversi game created in C++ which features 2 different AIs: Pure monte-carlo tree search AI, and a Heursitics monte-carlo tree search AI that utilizes reversi strategies.

Players can choose whether or not they want to go first or second against these AIs, or if they just want to, they can play against another human.

There is also an option at the end to run some statistical analysis with 2 AIs against each other.
